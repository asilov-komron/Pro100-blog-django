# Python Django Pet Project

Hi there! 

Thank you for checking out my pet project built with the **Python Django** stack! 

To get started and run the app successfully on your local machine, please follow these steps:

## 1. Create a virtual environment

Creating a virtual environment is recommended for isolating dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## 2. Activate the virtual environment

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## 3. Install the required dependencies

Install the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Check Python version compatibility

Make sure you're using a **compatible Python version** as specified in the projectâ€™s requirements. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## 5. Set up the database and environment variables

If necessary, **migrate the database** and set up any required environment variables.

## Good luck!

Once everything is set up, you should be ready to run the project smoothly! ðŸ˜Š Feel free to reach out if you run into any issues!
